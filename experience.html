            <li>Java was the first programming language I was introduced to in school. I took four classes using java.
                This includes data structures and algorithms.</li>

            <li>I have dealt with C programming when dealing with components closer to the hardware.
                I've used it when programming with an arduino board and AVR Assembly.
                This was also the language I used when building a compiler and adding syntax semantic action.</li>

            <li>I have experience with assembly language programming. This was the output of my compiler in 
                the final stage. I also used AVR commands while experimenting with the arduino board.</li>
