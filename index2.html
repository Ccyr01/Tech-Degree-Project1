            <li>Java</li>
            <p>-Java was the first programming language I was introduced to in school. I took four classes using java.
                This includes data structures and algorithms.
            </p>
            <li>C</li>
            <p>-I have dealt with C programming when dealing with components closer to the hardware.
                I've used it when programming with an arduino board and AVR Assembly.
                This was also the language I used when building a compiler and adding syntax semantic action.
            </p>
            <li>Assembly languages</li>
            <p>-I have experience with assembly language programming. This was the output of my compiler in 
                the final stage. I also used AVR commands while experimenting with the arduino board.
            </p>
            <li>R </li>
            <p>-The R programming I learned was for dealing with statistics problems and large datasets.</p>
          </ul>

          <ul class = "school">
              <li>HTML</li>
              <p>-The foundation of web developing. I learned commands in HTML that are a series of tags, to structure webpages</p>
              <li>CSS</li>
              <p>-The CSS I'm learning is to enhance the webpage with better color, designs, and fonts</p>
              <li>Javascript</li>
              <p>-I've learned javascript is the best route to make the site user interactive.
                  Most of the syntax is relatable to JAVA.
